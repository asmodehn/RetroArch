# ErlCast

This aims at providing an interface for erlang to retroarch,
in order to be able to launch core& content, and use it from another machine,
relying on erlang distributed runtime.

To broadcast games more widely (and appropriately scaling the backend) is much more challenging.
However, with erlcast working as expected, it will become possible via other erlang-based packages.

# Build

```
$ make
```


# Run

```
$ ./erlcast
```
